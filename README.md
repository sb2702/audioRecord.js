# audioRecord.js


⚠️This project is from 2015 and is deprecated. See the [MediaStream Recording API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API) for a native browser recording API



A simplified audio Recorder for HTML5, which uses the WebAudio API to export microphone input to wav, mp3 or ogg  files. Based on https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs, https://github.com/nusofthq/Recordmp3js and https://github.com/bjornm/libvorbis-js



### Quick and dirty Usage


     audioRecorder.requestDevice(function(recorder){
      // Create a recorder object (this will ask browser for microphone access)

		recorder.start();         // Start recording

		setTimeout(function(){     // Stop recording after 5 seconds
	      
			 recorder.stop();

			 recorder.exportMP3(function(mp3Blob){ // Export the recording as a Blob
				  
				   
				console.log("Here is your blob: " + URL.createObjectURL(mp3Blob));
				//Do something with your blob
			       
			 
			 });
			  
		}, 5000);       

            
     });



### Syntax
#### Constructor


**Basic / Async Construction** The recorder object is instatiated asynchronously as shown below. Calling the recorder function will ask the client for access to the device's microphone. Once the client agrees, the callback is called, providing the recorder object


	     audioRecorder.requestDevice(function(recorder){
	      // Create a recorder object (this will ask browser for microphone access)

	     } [,config]);


**From Media Source / Sync Construction**  The recorder object can be instatiated synchronously if you want to specify the media source manually.


      var recorder = audioRecorder.fromSource(source [,config]);

Example:

	  window.AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
		  navigator.getUserMedia = ( navigator.getUserMedia ||
		  navigator.webkitGetUserMedia ||
		  navigator.mozGetUserMedia ||
		  navigator.msGetUserMedia);
		  window.URL = window.URL || window.webkitURL;

		  audio_context = new AudioContext;


		  navigator.getUserMedia({audio: true}, function(stream){

		          var source = audio_context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);

			  var recorder  = audioRecorder.fromSource(source);

		  }, function(e) {
  
		       //Error handling
			
		  });



- **config** - (*optional*) A configuration object (see **config** section below)

---------
#### Config


- **workerPath** - Path to recorder.js worker script. Defaults to 'js/recorderjs/recorderWorker.js'
- **mp3LibPath** - Name of the mp3 conversion library, relative to the location of "workerPath". Defaults to 'libmp3lame.min.js'
- **vorbisLibPath** - Name of the vorbis conversion library, relative to the location of "workerPath". Defaults to 'libvorbis.module.min.js'. If you specify a non-default path, be sure to include 'libvorbis.module.min.jis.mem' in the same path
- **bufferLen** - The length of the buffer that the internal JavaScriptNode uses to capture the audio. Can be tweaked if experiencing performance issues. Defaults to 4096.
- **callback** - A default callback to be used with `exportWAV`.
- **type** - The type of the Blob generated by `exportWAV`. Defaults to 'audio/wav'.
- **recordAsMP3** - Binary: if true - will continuously encode the stream into mp3 format, making MP3 exports much faster, especially for recordings of over 10 seconds. Defaults to false


**TODO** continuously encoding OGG provides a codec error, figure out why

---------
#### Instance Methods

    rec.record()
    rec.stop()

Pretty self-explanatory... **record** will begin capturing audio and **stop** will cease capturing audio. Subsequent calls to **record** will add to the current recording.

    rec.clear()

This will clear the recording.

    rec.exportWAV([callback][, type])

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in WAV format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If a callback is not specified, the default callback (as defined in the config) will be used. If no default has been set, an error will be thrown.

    rec.exportMP3([callback])

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in MP3 format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If a callback is not specified, the default callback (as defined in the config) will be used. If no default has been set, an error will be thrown.

    rec.exportOGG([callback])

This will generate a Blob object containing the recording in OGG format. The callback will be called with the Blob as its sole argument. If a callback is not specified, the default callback (as defined in the config) will be used. If no default has been set, an error will be thrown.


In addition, you may specify the type of Blob to be returned (defaults to 'audio/wav').

    rec.getBuffer([callback])

This will pass the recorded stereo buffer (as an array of two Float32Arrays, for the separate left and right channels) to the callback. It can be played back by creating a new source buffer and setting these buffers as the separate channel data:

	function getBufferCallback( buffers ) {
		var newSource = audioContext.createBufferSource();
		var newBuffer = audioContext.createBuffer( 2, buffers[0].length, audioContext.sampleRate );
		newBuffer.getChannelData(0).set(buffers[0]);
		newBuffer.getChannelData(1).set(buffers[1]);
		newSource.buffer = newBuffer;

		newSource.connect( audioContext.destination );
		newSource.start(0);
	}

This sample code will play back the stereo buffer.


    rec.configure(config)

This will set the configuration for Recorder by passing in a config object.

#### Utility Methods (static)

    Recorder.forceDownload(blob[, filename])

This method will force a download using the new anchor link *download* attribute. Filename defaults to 'output.wav'.
